# [CancellationException](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-cancellation-exception/)

- If you catch a `CancellationException`, rethrow it. But how?
  - Rethrowing the `CancellationException` with `throw` is the second best.
  - Rethrowing the `CancellationException` with `ensureActive()` is best.

## kotlinlang.org
> The same problem can be observed by catching a CancellationException and not rethrowing it:

> While catching Exception is an anti-pattern, this issue may surface in more subtle ways, like when using the runCatching function, which does not rethrow CancellationException.

https://kotlinlang.org/docs/cancellation-and-timeouts.html#cancellation-is-cooperative

> This means that await can throw CancellationException in two cases:<br>
> if the coroutine in which await was called got cancelled,<br>
> or if the Deferred itself got completed with a CancellationException.

https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-deferred/await.html

## Detekt
> Using `runCatching` increases this risk of mis-handling cancellation. If you catch and don't rethrow all the `CancellationException`, your coroutines are not cancelled even if you cancel their `CoroutineScope`.
>
> This can very easily lead to:
> - unexpected crashes
> - extremely hard to diagnose bugs
> - memory leaks
> - performance issues
> - battery drain

# Flow's `count()`, `toList()`, `drop()`, `take()`, `first()`, and `single()`

```kotlin
val flow = flowOf("a", "b", "c")

println(flow.count()) // 3
println(flow.count { it == "b" }) // 1
println(flow.toList()) // [a, b, c]
println(flow.drop(1).take(1).toList()) // [b]
println(flow.first()) // a
println(flow.single()) // IllegalArgumentException: Flow has more than one element
```

# Four ways to update the value of `MutableStateFlow`

```kotlin
val _stateFlow = MutableStateFlow("")
val stateFlow = _stateFlow.asStateFlow()

_stateFlow.tryEmit("a")
println(stateFlow.value) // a

coroutineScope { _stateFlow.emit("b") }
println(stateFlow.value) // b

_stateFlow.update { "c" }
println(stateFlow.value) // c

_stateFlow.value = "d"
println(stateFlow.value) // d
```

# `StateFlow` is preferred over `SharedFlow`

> The recommended way to expose a Flow from a ViewModel is with a StateFlow

https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-update-data-room#2

> There are more types of flows, but this is what we recommend because we can optimize StateFlow very precisely.

# `repeatOnLifecycle()` is preferred over `asLiveData()` or `flowWithLifecycle()`

# Even with the `catch` operator, the backing Flow still terminates.

> Note: The catch operator only prevents the exception from crashing the app, the backing Flow still terminates. To

# Cold stream versus hot stream (Cold flow versus hot flow)

 e.g. (regular) flow                                                                      | e.g. Channel, StateFlow, LiveData                                                                                                                         

The analogy for a hot stream is a hot spring. It gushes out whether a user exists.

# `yield()`

* forcibly start child jobs. If `yield()` is not called before `child.cancel()`, the child job may not start by the
  time `child.cancel()` is called, so the `finally` block won't be executed when `child.cancel()` is called.

# SupervisorJob

- If a child job throws an exception other than CancellationException, its parent and sibling jobs are NOT canceled.
    - i.e. Failure propagates downward only.

```
